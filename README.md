# -Diagnosis-Of-Melanoma-Using-CNN
 There are around 200 distinct cancers. With a death incidence of 1 in 200, melanoma is among the worst types of skin cancer. 
 Dermatoscopic examination, histological examination, and clinical screening are all steps in the diagnosis of melanoma. 
 If detected early, the skin cancer melanoma is very treatable.
 A visual inspection of the affected area of the skin is the first step in the diagnosis of melanoma. 
 Without any additional technology assistance, dermatologists utilize a high-speed camera to capture dermatoscopic images of skin lesions. 
 In order to categorize skin cancer using photos of skin lesions, the project intends to develop an automated classification system based on image processing techniques.
 Convolutional neural network designs like RESNet and Inception could be used to extract the patterns of skin lesions. 
 Convolutional neural network designs InceptionV3 and ResNet50, which were implemented using the application Keras, were used to extract picture features.
 In addition to the characteristics collected with CNNs, another descriptor was used to examine skin lesions. 
 An inception network is a type of deep neural network that has an architectural structure made up of repeating elements called Inception modules.
